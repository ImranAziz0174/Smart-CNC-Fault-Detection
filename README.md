# Smart-CNC-Fault-Detection
In this project, I developed a data-driven monitoring system for CNC machines to predict tool wear and detect clamping faults using machine learning techniques in Python. The dataset, sourced from the SMART Lab at the University of Michigan, included time-series sensor data and metadata from 18 controlled milling experiments. Each experiment captured high-frequency measurements such as motor current, velocity, and power, alongside key labels like tool condition and visual inspection outcomes. I began with extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns in sensor behavior and identify influential variables across different machining conditions.

To model these fault conditions, I extracted statistical features from the time-series data and trained classification models using Logistic Regression and XGBoost. The tool wear prediction task proved challenging due to class imbalance and subtle signal differences, but XGBoost significantly improved accuracy and recall over the baseline model. For clamping fault detection, both models performed well, with Logistic Regression showing strong reliability. Feature selection, confusion matrices, and performance metrics guided model evaluation and refinement. This project demonstrates the practical potential of combining sensor analytics with machine learning for smarter, real-time fault detection in manufacturing systems.
